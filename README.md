Ever wonder where all the css grids are that allow you to create full width and full height web layouts?

## Grid Basics

### Basic grid set up

```html
<div class="grid columns split250">
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <div class="content"></div>
</div>
```

## That's it? What does it mean?!

**Molten** gives you classes to create grids based on columns and rows.
